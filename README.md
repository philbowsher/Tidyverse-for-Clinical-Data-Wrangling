Live Presentation is here:

Presentations and code from workshop.

Requires the following packages from CRAN:

```r
install.packages(c("leaflet", "tidyverse", shiny", "shinydashboard", "rmarkdown", "flex_dashboard", "ggplot2", "plotly", "plyr", "reshape2"))
``` 

To access to the OpenFDA API from R, which uses the jsonlite and magrittr packages, you'll need the devtools package to install it as the library has not yet been added to CRAN, so follow these steps:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once devtools is installed, you can grab this package:

```r
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenhealth/openfda")
```
Load it in like any other package:

```r
library("openfda")
```

An up-to-date version of RStudio is also recommended.

R 3.4.0 used for examples.
